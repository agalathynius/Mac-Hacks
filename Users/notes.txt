## Create a user account on Mac OS X that does not show up in user list:
## NOTE that on Mac OS X Yosemite, this user will not show up in System Preferences > Users & Groups,
## but will still show up in fast user switching menu bar (if you have fast switching enabled)

## First, we’ll create a new entry for the user under /Users:
dscl . create /Users/gituser
Next, create and set the shell property to bash:
dscl . create /Users/gituser UserShell /usr/local/bin/zsh
## create and set a unique ID for the user. Pick whatever works for you here, ensuring that it hasn’t been used by previous users:
dscl . create /Users/gituser UniqueID 599
## Next, we’ll create and set the user’s group ID property:
dscl . create /Users/gituser PrimaryGroupID 20
## Now, we’ll set the user’s home directory by running the following command.
## Ensure that you replace both instances of the shortname in the command below:
dscl . create /Users/gituser NFSHomeDirectory /Local/Users/gituser
## NOTE - I did not set a password, as I only want to able to access this account via sudo command
## add some security to the user account and set their password.
## Here, you’ll replace "PASSWORD" with the actual password that will be used initially for their account.
## The user can always change the password later:
dscl . passwd /Users/gituser PASSWORD
